
The goal of this fork is to get u-boot-sboot to work with Beagle Bone Black and Cryptocape.

=============
ATMEL's AT97SC3204T I2C TPM -- U-boot support

Note: This only includes a board config for the BeagleBone: am335x_evm_tpm

Instructions:
=============

1. Install an ARMv7 cross compiler.
2. make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/cross/compiler am335x_evm_tpm_config
3. make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/cross/compiler
4. Move the compiled MLO and u-boot.img to your BeagleBone.

You may need to change settings in /include/configs/am335x_evm.h to 
match your boot, kernel, or partition configuration.

Add TPM Support:
================

Use the following defines to add AT97SC3204T support to additional boards.

In your board configuration, add:
 #define CONFIG_TPM
 #define CONFIG_TPM_I2C_ATMEL
 #define CONFIG_TPM_I2C_BUS <number>
 #define CONFIG_TPM_I2C_ADDR 0x29
 #define CONFIG_CMD_TPM
